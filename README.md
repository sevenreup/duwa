# Duwa Programming Language (in progress)
This project is an interpreter for the `duwa` language (Name still getting worked shopped), a language based on the Chewa Bantu language.
This project is written in Golang.

## Setup and Moni ku dziko
Download the prebuilt binaries for your platform from the [release](https://github.com/sevenreup/duwa/releases)

Create a new source file, `main.ny` (ðŸ’€ for now the extension does not matter).

Paste the following cool code

```c#
lemba("Moni Dziko");
```
Run you new application

```bash
duwa -f ./main.ny
```

## Zowerenga bwa?
Documentation is on its way, stay on the cutting edge and freestyle your code.

You can check out examples in `./examples` folder to quickly see what the language can do for now.
